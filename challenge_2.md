# Challenge #2 Bonus Points

Main Points:

You will replace the batch based architecture to go real time in data capture. For that you need to:

• Implement an API capable of recieving JSON objects and send those objets to three different queues. One to parse data into
tabular data load it in a DB engine, another one to store the same data in csv format, and a third one to log messages in text files.
All of them should be able to respond to an eventual big message load.

• Incorrect values should be handled sepparately to go to an error file.
