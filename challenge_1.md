# Challenge #1

Main Points:

* Define the structure of the XML document.
• Create a batch process using ETL tool (PDI community edition) to parse the data and store it in tabular CSV files in a normalized
form.
• You need to source and destination data files and the PDI package.
• The ETL job must handle failure rolling back the changes and send a success/failure notification to an email address.
• A second ETL must move normalized data to some datawarehouse csv files using a schema optimized for reporting.

Bonus points:
• You are free to add more attributes to the JSON source to build a richer table structure.
• ETL could process correct records and derive incorrect ones to an error file

## Getting Started

Once you have installed your PDI tool, you have to unzip the [file]
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
