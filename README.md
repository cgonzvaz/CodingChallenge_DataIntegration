# Coding Challenge Data Integration

This repository contains development code related to the Adidas challenge about Data Integration.
The Challenge is divided in two parts:

Part I: The Basics
The eCommerce company owning the app would like to:
1) Reliably capture the incoming message stream where there could be large
fluctuations in the number of messages being received at a given time (eg sales on
Cyber Monday)
2) Queue the data for further processing
3) Parse the data to tabular structures
4) Forward the data to tables in a data warehouse for analysis and reporting teams

Part II: Bonus Points

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the PDI (Pentaho Data Integration) software, version 8.2
* [Pentaho Data Integration 8.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/latest/download?aliId=137249511)

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
